00:00:01,669 --> 00:00:04,839
TED:
Kids, the early bloom of
a romance is a wonderful thing.

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:08,505
You meet someone, you have
a connection, and that person

3
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:10,536
becomes sheer perfection
in your eyes.

4
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:13,281
You just can't find
anything wrong with them.

5
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,417
You can't wait to tell
the world about it.

6
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:17,053
She convinced you
to go jogging?

7
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,948
Wow, you really want to get
in this girl's pants.

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,820
I'm telling you,
you guys are gonna love her.

9
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,059
Lily, she knows all about art.

10
00:00:23,124 --> 00:00:24,134
Marshall,

11
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,832
she's open to the
existence of UFOs.

12
00:00:25,893 --> 00:00:27,103
Barney,

13
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,331
she's hot. Robin,

14
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,926
she's not hotter than you.

15
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:33,327
Like her already.
How not hotter?

16
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,601
So we all went out to dinner,
and I couldn't wait

17
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:38,269
to see if my friends were
as crazy about Cathy as I was.

18
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:40,039
So, what's everyone getting?

19
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:42,208
Well, I can't decide.

20
00:00:42,276 --> 00:00:44,276
Which sounds better,
chicken or lasagna?

21
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:47,415
Lasagna. Just get the lasagna!

22
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:50,121
Oh. You guys just
got a new place.

23
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:51,824
How many bedrooms is it?

24
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,115
Two. It's two bedrooms!

25
00:00:56,790 --> 00:00:59,230
Okay! Let's hear it.

26
00:00:59,293 --> 00:01:00,493
What's wrong with Cathy?

27
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:03,261
Are you kidding me, Ted?
She's got a...

28
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:05,101
You don't notice it?

29
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,166
Notice what?

30
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:07,704
Oh, he doesn't see it.

31
00:01:07,768 --> 00:01:10,538
If we point it out, we're
gonna ruin her for him.

32
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:11,474
As his friends,

33
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:13,669
we'll just keep
him in the dark.

34
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:14,241
You're right.

35
00:01:14,308 --> 00:01:16,438
She's great, man.

36
00:01:17,211 --> 00:01:18,911
She's a keeper. Just...

37
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:20,049
keep her somewhere else.

38
00:01:20,114 --> 00:01:21,524
(giggling)

39
00:01:35,363 --> 00:01:38,433
Marshall, what is everyone's
problem with Cathy?

40
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,899
Oh, she's a total nightmare,
Ted,

41
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:40,897
but can we talk
about this later?

42
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,138
I'm a minute away

43
00:01:42,203 --> 00:01:44,313
from finding out if I'm
gonna be a lawyer or not.

44
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:45,542
You see, kids,
during the summer,

45
00:01:45,606 --> 00:01:47,436
Marshall had taken
the New York Bar exam.

46
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:50,578
His years of school,
his countless hours of study,

47
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,614
had finally culminated in this
grueling, two-day ordeal.

48
00:01:53,681 --> 00:01:55,881
And... begin.

49
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,989
(vomiting)

50
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,692
The pressure of it
was enormous.

51
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:03,724
Every year, people taking
the bar simply cracked.

52
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:06,061
No! No!

53
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,226
No!

54
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,465
(shrieking):
No!

55
00:02:12,666 --> 00:02:13,866
But Marshall
had made it through.

56
00:02:13,934 --> 00:02:14,874
And...

57
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:16,335
time.

58
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,847
Time's up.

59
00:02:24,912 --> 00:02:25,912
Right.

60
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:26,749
Time.

61
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:28,921
Sir.
I know.

62
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:30,652
Your time is...
I know it is.

63
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:31,618
Give me...!

64
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:36,891
Now, months later, the results
of that exam were scheduled

65
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,957
to post online at 10:00,

66
00:02:39,026 --> 00:02:40,286
and it was 9:59.

67
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:41,631
Damn, they're not up yet.

68
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:44,425
Oh, don't worry, baby.
I'm sure you rocked it.

69
00:02:44,498 --> 00:02:46,498
I mean, how many people
fail the bar?

70
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,197
Half.

71
00:02:47,268 --> 00:02:48,498
Oh, my God, half?

72
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:50,869
Only half the people pass?

73
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:52,068
I mean, half the people pass.

74
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,039
That's fantastic.

75
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,206
Go, Marshall.

76
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:55,705
Oh, hey, can I
jump on there?

77
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,946
I want to show you
something awesome.
What?

78
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,981
No. Bar results. My future.

79
00:03:00,047 --> 00:03:01,477
Trust me. You
need to see this.

80
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:04,049
What is so important
that I need to see it right now?

81
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:07,657
It's a video of a dog
pooping on a baby.

82
00:03:08,956 --> 00:03:11,326
How do I need to see that?

83
00:03:11,392 --> 00:03:13,092
Why would I want to see that?

84
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,770
In what possible way could
subjecting my eyes and my brain

85
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,971
to something that disgusting
enrich my life?

86
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:24,343
It's a dog pooping on a baby.

87
00:03:24,405 --> 00:03:25,765
Get away from my computer.

88
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:29,309
Okay, just do a quick Google
search for "caca spaniel."

89
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,307
The results are in.

90
00:03:30,378 --> 00:03:32,048
Whoo. What's it say?

91
00:03:32,112 --> 00:03:33,982
"Input password."

92
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,877
ALL:
Input the password.

93
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,119
It's okay. They assigned it
to me when I took the test.

94
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:40,045
It's gotta be around here
somewhere.

95
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,990
Here. Here-here-here.

96
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:44,185
Jelly beans, fluffernutter,
Gummi Bears, ginger snaps...

97
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:45,928
This is a grocery list.

98
00:03:45,993 --> 00:03:49,233
For who? A witch building
a house in the forest?

99
00:03:49,297 --> 00:03:51,267
Sugar helps me study.

100
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,702
This is like the shopping
a ten-year-old does

101
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:55,697
when his parents leave him alone
for the weekend.

102
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,309
What parent leaves a ten-
year-old alone for the weekend?

103
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:00,572
And your mom was perfect.

104
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:02,811
I can't find my password!
Okay, just...

105
00:04:02,876 --> 00:04:04,706
can't you let 'em know
that you lost it

106
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:06,378
and they'll e-mail it
to you or something?

107
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:08,247
No! They won't
let me do that.

108
00:04:08,316 --> 00:04:09,976
I'm gonna have to wait
till the results come

109
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,150
in the regular mail.

110
00:04:11,218 --> 00:04:12,518
That could be weeks from now,
if ever!

111
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,456
Our mail carrier hates me
ever since I asked her

112
00:04:14,522 --> 00:04:15,462
when the baby was due.

113
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,823
She wasn't pregnant?

114
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,390
No, he was not.

115
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,329
Ooh. Okay, well,
that's a drag,

116
00:04:20,394 --> 00:04:21,564
but the results
will come eventually.

117
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:23,729
Just try to keep it off
your mind until then.

118
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,867
(phone ringing)

119
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,174
Hey, Brad.

120
00:04:28,235 --> 00:04:30,465
Oh, congratulations, man.

121
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:33,338
I'm, uh... I'm not sure yet.

122
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,807
I lost my password.

123
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,146
That's great, Cara.

124
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,411
I don't know yet.
I lost my password.

125
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,921
I don't know how I lost it!

126
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,153
This stuff happens!

127
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:47,487
Oh. Ohh! You're one to talk.

128
00:04:47,555 --> 00:04:50,615
You misplace stuff all the time.

129
00:04:50,691 --> 00:04:52,031
I'm sorry.

130
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:55,362
I'm sure the nurses are
stealing your medicine, Grandma.

131
00:04:56,196 --> 00:04:57,826
Love you, too.

132
00:04:57,898 --> 00:05:00,628
If I have to wait six weeks
to find out if I passed,

133
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:02,171
I-I'm gonna have
a heart attack.

134
00:05:02,235 --> 00:05:06,265
Based on that grocery list, I'd
say diabetes is a bigger worry.

135
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,780
You know what?
Laugh all you want.

136
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:09,741
This affects my whole
future, all right?

137
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:10,740
(laughing)

138
00:05:10,811 --> 00:05:11,781
Okay.

139
00:05:11,845 --> 00:05:13,405
I probably shouldn't
be telling you this.

140
00:05:13,481 --> 00:05:14,821
I definitely shouldn't
be telling you this,

141
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:17,222
but there is a way I can
help you with your problem.

142
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,754
How?

143
00:05:19,953 --> 00:05:21,293
I know a guy at work.

144
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:25,355
He can get access to software
designed to penetrate firewalls

145
00:05:25,426 --> 00:05:27,426
and retrieve passwords
through secure servers.

146
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:29,495
I can get into any computer.

147
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:32,203
So what do we do? Like,
arrange a secret meeting

148
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,865
in a darkened parking structure?

149
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,144
No.

150
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:35,872
Can we?

151
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,896
No.

152
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,840
I have a trench coat.

153
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:38,865
Dude, be cool.

154
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:46,414
So, I just got off the phone
with Cathy.

155
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,020
God, you guys are so right.

156
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,621
I totally hear it now.

157
00:05:50,451 --> 00:05:51,691
See it now?

158
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:53,586
Smell it?

159
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:55,722
What is it?!

160
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:57,319
I left the table
for two minutes.

161
00:05:57,391 --> 00:05:58,561
What could she have
possibly done

162
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:00,556
in that time that was
so horrible? Was it...

163
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:02,128
I'll be back in one second.

164
00:06:03,897 --> 00:06:07,227
One time, in the tenth grade,
as a joke, I told everyone

165
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:10,740
that my English teacher
had sex with me.

166
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,314
(Cathy laughs)

167
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,742
He's still in jail.

168
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,578
Or maybe...

169
00:06:15,643 --> 00:06:17,583
I'll be back in a second.

170
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:21,112
So I volunteer at the pound.

171
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:22,881
Oh, isn't that nice?

172
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,790
Yeah. You can't imagine
the rush you get

173
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:27,863
from killing an unwanted puppy.

174
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,559
I make bracelets
out of the collars.

175
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:33,456
Or...

176
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,027
I'll be back in one second.

177
00:06:36,564 --> 00:06:39,574
I bet he's going to the urinal.

178
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,797
Yeah.

179
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:43,669
I remember when I had a penis.

180
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:48,008
It wasn't anything she did
while you were in the bathroom.

181
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,875
It's just the way she is.

182
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:51,683
I don't get it.

183
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,175
If it's so obvious
and you guys all see it,

184
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,576
how come I don't?

185
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:56,448
'Cause we're not trying
to have sex with her.

186
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:57,717
Mmm.
Brother,

187
00:06:57,785 --> 00:06:59,815
you're driving the "I want
to have sex with her" truck,

188
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:02,057
and it's got a huge blind spot.

189
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,992
That's ridiculous.

190
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:05,657
Is it really?

191
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:07,856
Ted, let me tell you
a little story

192
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:11,028
about a young lady I wanted
to have sex with-- Lucilia.

193
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,865
On a white sand beach
in Rio de Janeiro,

194
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:18,935
we made love
for ten straight hours.

195
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:20,206
When we were done,

196
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,813
she applauded

197
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:24,875
and told me
I was far, far better

198
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,875
than the best lover
she could possibly imagine,

199
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:32,548
and that I had restored
her faith in God.

200
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:35,357
What does this
have to do with Cathy?

201
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,062
Who's Cathy?

202
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,531
Just tell me what the hell

203
00:07:39,593 --> 00:07:41,063
is wrong with her already.

204
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:43,198
Okay. You want to know?

205
00:07:43,263 --> 00:07:44,263
Yes.

206
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,601
You want to shatter

207
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:47,366
this beautiful illusion
you've created for yourself?

208
00:07:47,434 --> 00:07:49,204
Fine. Here it is.

209
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:54,469
Cathy talks... a lot.

210
00:07:55,609 --> 00:07:57,479
Oh, come on.

211
00:07:57,545 --> 00:07:58,605
That's not true.

212
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:02,279
Ted. Really, really
think about that dinner

213
00:08:02,349 --> 00:08:03,449
we all just had together.

214
00:08:03,517 --> 00:08:04,847
And I did.

215
00:08:04,918 --> 00:08:07,018
So, what's
everyone getting?

216
00:08:07,087 --> 00:08:08,987
Well, I can't decide.

217
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:11,216
Which sounds better,
chicken or lasagna?

218
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,331
I like chicken.

219
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,592
I like lasagna.
I like them both,

220
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,701
but I really like pork.

221
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:15,832
A lot of people don't

222
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:17,026
eat pork, and
maybe it's because

223
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,327
of that movie Babe
or something.

224
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,428
But that was funny.

225
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,469
He was a talking pig

226
00:08:20,534 --> 00:08:21,544
and he was like
"Bah, Ram, Ewe!"

227
00:08:21,602 --> 00:08:22,672
What-what if

228
00:08:22,736 --> 00:08:24,266
there was a sorority,
"Bah, Ram, Ewe?"

229
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:25,367
I'd totally rush it.

230
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,308
...And so I named him
Dr. Seuss!

231
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,875
Lorax is a funny word.

232
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,583
Lasagna! Just get the lasagna!

233
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,276
Oh, you guys
just got a new place.

234
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:36,118
How many bedrooms

235
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:36,853
is it?

236
00:08:36,917 --> 00:08:37,687
I would love

237
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,891
to have an extra bedroom,

238
00:08:38,952 --> 00:08:40,152
because I would put
a Stairmaster in there.

239
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,290
But you guts should get
a convertible sofa.

240
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:43,555
Or a futon.
Futons are great.

241
00:08:43,624 --> 00:08:44,564
Or what about
one of those

242
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:45,455
Murphy beds?

243
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:46,455
Who invented the Murphy bed?

244
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:47,426
Was it a guy named Murphy?

245
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,664
Oh, my God.

246
00:08:48,729 --> 00:08:50,329
Do you guys remember
that show Murphy Brown?

247
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:51,667
That was a funny show.

248
00:08:51,732 --> 00:08:53,502
She had a new assistant
every episode.

249
00:08:53,567 --> 00:08:54,967
...and it was like
half an hour

250
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,165
before I realized he wasn't
even on the phone anymore!

251
00:08:57,237 --> 00:08:59,207
Isn't that hysterical?

252
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:01,242
Two! It's two bedrooms!

253
00:09:01,308 --> 00:09:04,238
Hey, do you guys
like cannolis?

254
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:06,251
Because I know this place
and it's in the South Bronx

255
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:07,413
and you wouldn't expect it,

256
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,320
but they have the best
cannolis in town.

257
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,652
(glass shattering)

258
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:13,018
And just like that,
the illusion was shattered.

259
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:14,386
Wow.

260
00:09:14,454 --> 00:09:17,594
She just never
shuts up, does she?

261
00:09:17,658 --> 00:09:19,228
She didn't stop

262
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,762
to swallow her food.

263
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:21,928
I was scared for her.

264
00:09:21,995 --> 00:09:23,625
I didn't want her
to choke.

265
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:25,097
At first.

266
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:32,707
So kids, this girl I was dating
would not stop talking.

267
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:34,783
Can you imagine
how awful that is?

268
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,906
(chattering)

269
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,380
Do you own a wok?

270
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,678
'Cause that's really how...

271
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:46,421
Don't you just love autumn?

272
00:09:46,486 --> 00:09:47,916
Today I'm dressed for...

273
00:09:47,988 --> 00:09:50,618
Oh, my God. The sweetest thing.

274
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:53,391
And I know this great place
where we can go.

275
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:55,030
They have guys
and girls clothes.

276
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,795
We could both shop
at the same time.

277
00:09:56,864 --> 00:09:58,874
And a lot of times boyfriends
and girlfriends...

278
00:09:58,932 --> 00:09:59,802
Hey!

279
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:01,327
Why are you running so fast?

280
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,969
Well, thank you, pal.

281
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,738
You and your
little friends,

282
00:10:06,807 --> 00:10:08,007
you just had
to tell me.

283
00:10:08,075 --> 00:10:10,405
You just had to give in
to my incessant begging.

284
00:10:10,477 --> 00:10:11,707
You said
that you wanted to know.

285
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:13,579
I didn't want to know!

286
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:15,247
You said you wanted to know!

287
00:10:15,315 --> 00:10:17,575
Well, I didn't know
I didn't want to know!

288
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:19,691
You knew.
And you know me.

289
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:22,223
And you should have known
I didn't want to know!

290
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,259
You know?

291
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:26,064
I'm sorry we told you.

292
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:28,126
I'm surprised she didn't tell
you herself at some point.

293
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,695
There's only a finite
combination of words

294
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:30,833
in the English language.

295
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,568
Well, you could have let me
enjoy it a little longer.

296
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,533
She's got all these

297
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:35,941
other great qualities.

298
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:37,873
She's smart. She's caring.
She loves animals...

299
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,668
You know how
to teach her a lesson?

300
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,840
Buy her a parrot.

301
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:45,005
Oh, come on. I'm sorry
that we told you, okay?

302
00:10:45,078 --> 00:10:47,078
It's part of being
in a relationship.

303
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:49,477
Eventually, you get used
to these annoying little things

304
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:50,649
that bug you at first.

305
00:10:50,718 --> 00:10:52,448
Yeah, I guess.

306
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:54,989
I mean, you got used
to Lily's loud chewing, right?

307
00:10:57,024 --> 00:10:58,664
Lily doesn't chew loudly.

308
00:10:58,726 --> 00:11:00,686
Dude...

309
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,901
Come on. This isn't news.

310
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:04,733
Why do you think I call her
"Chewbacca"?

311
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:07,838
I assumed because she's loyal,
wears shiny belts

312
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:10,241
and I resemble
a young Harrison Ford.

313
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,273
Think about it.

314
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,440
(crunching loudly)

315
00:11:20,247 --> 00:11:22,317
(crunching loudly)

316
00:11:31,258 --> 00:11:34,228
(inhaling loudly)

317
00:11:40,167 --> 00:11:43,297
Oh, man, honestly, dude,
that's the meanest thing

318
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:44,400
you've ever done to me.

319
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:46,241
I really thought you knew.

320
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:48,836
We had ribs the other night.
It sounded like Jurassic Park.

321
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:51,239
Ha-ha-ha. You know what?

322
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,581
It doesn't matter.

323
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,645
But it did.

324
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:59,323
(crunching loudly)

325
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:16,097
Say, what's in that cereal

326
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:19,539
besides dry twigs
and small animal bones?

327
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:21,236
What's that supposed to mean?

328
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:24,308
Lily, I love you,
but honest to God,

329
00:12:24,377 --> 00:12:26,677
when you eat, it sounds like
a garbage disposal

330
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:27,846
full of drywall screws.

331
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:30,475
What's the matter with you?

332
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:32,850
We've been together ten years,
and you're saying this now?

333
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,690
Well, I never noticed it before
until...

334
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,226
Until what?

335
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,091
Can you believe Ted?

336
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:42,599
What a lame thing to say,
that I'm a loud chewer.

337
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,532
(crunching loudly)

338
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:47,197
Yeah, that's crazy.

339
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,366
Maybe enough with the pretzels.

340
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:54,638
Oh, my God, do I really chew
that loudly?

341
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:57,307
No, no, no.

342
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,175
Okay, now that
you pointed it out,

343
00:13:00,247 --> 00:13:04,117
maybe it does sound
slightly like someone put

344
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,554
a screwdriver
in a pencil sharpener,

345
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:07,749
but in a cute way.

346
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,761
This is all Ted's fault.

347
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:13,464
Oh, like he's so perfect,
Mr. Corrector.

348
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,426
What do you mean?

349
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,004
Oh, come on. You dated
the guy for a year

350
00:13:17,064 --> 00:13:19,574
and you never noticed
that most of what Ted says

351
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:20,802
is correcting you.

352
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:23,873
Hey, can you hand me a Kleenex?

353
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:26,967
Actually, Kleenex
is a brand.

354
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,810
This is a facial tissue.

355
00:13:30,343 --> 00:13:33,113
Oh, my God, is Frankenstein
gonna kill that little girl?

356
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,720
Uh, Dr. Frankenstein
isn't in this scene.

357
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,292
That's Frankenstein's
monster.

358
00:13:39,419 --> 00:13:43,559
(sighs)
That literally
blew my mind.

359
00:13:43,623 --> 00:13:45,233
Figuratively.

360
00:13:45,292 --> 00:13:46,292
(both sigh)

361
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,828
Oh, my God, you're right.

362
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:52,097
That is so annoying.

363
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,825
Isn't it?
(crunching loudly)

364
00:13:53,901 --> 00:13:56,901
Where are those pretzels from,
Ace Hardware?

365
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:05,014
Hey, man,

366
00:14:05,078 --> 00:14:06,078
you like kettle corn?

367
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:07,476
I'm trying to get rid
of anything crunchy.

368
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:08,777
Are the blinds closed?

369
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,018
I don't know.

370
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,783
Are the blinds closed?!

371
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,691
Yes, the blinds are closed.

372
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,124
Good, I didn't think
I was followed,

373
00:14:16,189 --> 00:14:17,519
but you can never
be too sure.

374
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,260
Now double-lock
the door

375
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,125
and stay away
from the windows.

376
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,333
Is there a reason that
you're acting like this?

377
00:14:23,396 --> 00:14:25,796
We're about to find out
if you're a lawyer.

378
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:28,095
Now, in good conscience,
I have to inform you

379
00:14:28,168 --> 00:14:29,268
that using this software

380
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:30,996
is in violation
of the Patriot Act,

381
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,441
the Strategic Defense
Initiative,

382
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:37,276
and the National Security Act
of 1948, which created the CIA.

383
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:40,084
So I hope you passed
the bar because

384
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:43,747
if we use this software,
the night janitor Gligor

385
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,086
who I fooled into putting
fingerprints on my computer,

386
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:48,623
is going to need a good lawyer.

387
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,088
Are you certain you want
to go through with this?

388
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:53,927
I have to know,
yes, yes.

389
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:56,434
Very good.

390
00:14:56,496 --> 00:14:59,166
First, we go to the New York
State Bar Web site.

391
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:02,402
We disable the firewall,
then the recursive algorithm

392
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:06,139
grabs your password, and as
the application erases itself

393
00:15:06,206 --> 00:15:09,336
leaving no trace
we were here ever...

394
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:12,209
you ready
to see your future, bro?

395
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,409
Yes.

396
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:24,287
It's a dog pooping on a baby.

397
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:26,957
Right!
Isn't that awesome?

398
00:15:27,027 --> 00:15:28,257
So you went through
all this just to get me

399
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,558
to look at your
stupid video?

400
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:30,659
Yeah, it was worth it.

401
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,400
Barney, Barney, that was
the biggest test of my life.

402
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:36,166
I'm incredibly stressed out
right now, and I...

403
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:37,866
(dog barking, baby cooing)

404
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,937
Okay, that's
pretty funny.

405
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,110
You got to see this.

406
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:47,205
Uh-huh, yeah, I have to...

407
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:50,150
She'll call back
when she realizes I'm gone.

408
00:15:50,217 --> 00:15:52,287
Probably in about 45 minutes.

409
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:52,852
(both laugh)

410
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:55,219
Hey.
Hi.

411
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,588
You guys want a drink?

412
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,056
I'll just have
a water.

413
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,025
Mm, technically,
water is a drink.

414
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,327
Really, Professor?

415
00:16:02,395 --> 00:16:04,095
You drink it?
Is that how water works?

416
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:06,034
Because I was just gonna
smear it on my skin

417
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,329
and hope that I absorbed it.

418
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:10,838
Or you could, you know,
pour it over your shirt.

419
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,313
What's with you?

420
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:13,972
You're always correcting people.

421
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,311
You totally do that!
That's absolutely right.

422
00:16:17,377 --> 00:16:19,177
Right? I never
noticed it before,

423
00:16:19,246 --> 00:16:20,946
and now it's literally
driving me crazy.

424
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,784
Figuratively.

425
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:24,819
Okay, maybe so,
but it's no worse

426
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:26,794
than you using the word
"literally"

427
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:27,823
in every other
sentence.

428
00:16:27,887 --> 00:16:31,457
Don't they teach
vocabulary in Canada?

429
00:16:31,524 --> 00:16:34,834
They literally don't.
They literally don't.

430
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:36,034
Shut up, Marshall.

431
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,326
That's nothing compared

432
00:16:37,397 --> 00:16:39,427
to your thing of singing
what you do all the time.

433
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,399
What?

434
00:16:40,467 --> 00:16:44,437
* Paying my bills
using return address labels *

435
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:50,644
* From a charity
that I haven't given money to *

436
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:55,550
* Writing a check
'cause now I feel guilty *

437
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:58,845
* The Salivation Army
does not fight fair. *

438
00:16:58,918 --> 00:17:02,288
(crunching loudly)

439
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:05,685
* Heading down to
the basement today *

440
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,658
* With my laundry
and a roll of quarters *

441
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,532
* But I'm back too soon *

442
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,240
* 'Cause I left
the detergent *

443
00:17:15,302 --> 00:17:17,472
* And the fabric softener *

444
00:17:20,073 --> 00:17:22,583
Wow.
Those lines are
so sloppy.

445
00:17:22,642 --> 00:17:23,642
Oh, come on!

446
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,850
What about you, "Barney"?

447
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:28,582
Okay, you...

448
00:17:29,582 --> 00:17:30,352
always...

449
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,377
Interesting, interesting,

450
00:17:31,451 --> 00:17:33,521
everyone has annoying habits
but me.

451
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:36,216
Oh, got it.

452
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:41,189
Okay, you sometimes talk
in a weird high-pitched voice.

453
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:46,571
And you're constantly using
lame catchphrases.

454
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:49,873
And sometimes you space out
and don't even pay attention

455
00:17:49,936 --> 00:17:51,236
to what we're
talking about.

456
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,865
I'm sorry. What?

457
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,111
Oh, see?

458
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,476
You can't think of anything

459
00:17:57,544 --> 00:17:59,714
(high-pitched):
* 'Cause I'm awesome! *

460
00:17:59,779 --> 00:18:00,849
All three right there.

461
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:03,123
Well, technically, "awesome"
wouldn't be a catchphrase.

462
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:04,483
If anything,
it's more of a catchword.

463
00:18:04,551 --> 00:18:07,091
I literally want
to rip your head off.

464
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:09,294
You mean "figuratively"!

465
00:18:09,356 --> 00:18:12,226
No, I literally mean
"literally."

466
00:18:12,292 --> 00:18:15,562
(crunching loudly)
Literally, literally
literally.

467
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:18,268
Oh, my God, Lily, what
are you eating, gravel?

468
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:19,501
Oh, I know, right?

469
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:21,466
It sounds like cuff links
going up a vacuum cleaner.

470
00:18:21,534 --> 00:18:23,344
Well, why don't
you sing about it?

471
00:18:23,403 --> 00:18:25,913
Because I don't sing
about everything I do.

472
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,282
No, no, sometimes you just sing
nonsense sentences

473
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,582
like a stroke victim,

474
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,843
and what's worse,

475
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:33,181
they're catchy.

476
00:18:33,246 --> 00:18:37,646
* Apple, orchard, banana,
cat dance, 8663 *

477
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:39,787
See? We know that one
because once you sang that

478
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:42,892
for, like, three hours.
What the hell is that?

479
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,355
That's my password.

480
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:49,856
AOBCD8663.

481
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,903
(baby crying)
Oh, Marshall!
Awesome!

482
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,438
There's another one.

483
00:18:57,504 --> 00:18:59,574
It's called "Golden Reliever,"
where this dog...
Yeah,

484
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:00,939
we can guess.
All right, guys,

485
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,637
guys, guys.

486
00:19:06,112 --> 00:19:08,052
I'm a lawyer.

487
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:10,324
(all cheering)

488
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:11,823
And just like that

489
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:14,624
we stopped fighting and
celebrated Marshall's success.

490
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,917
You see, when someone's bad
habits are pointed out to you,

491
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:18,389
it's hard to ignore them.

492
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,928
* I'm a lawyer now
'cause I passed the bar *

493
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,933
* I'm imposing Marshall law
on this champagne. *

494
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:25,266
(all laughing)

495
00:19:25,332 --> 00:19:27,832
Are you literally
on cloud nine right now?

496
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,800
Baby, you never have
to take the bar again.

497
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,169
(crunches loudly)

498
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,168
Actually, if he practices law
in another state,

499
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,640
he will have to,

500
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:35,677
but New York, man!

501
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,212
It's a great state
to practice law in!

502
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,907
(high-pitched):
Lawsuit up!

503
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:39,908
Yeah!
Whoo!

504
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,209
Yeah!
Yeah!

505
00:19:41,281 --> 00:19:42,851
But if you love them enough,

506
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:45,345
those bad habits
are easy to forget.

507
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,022
Three years later, I ran into
Kathy, and she was doing well.

508
00:19:52,091 --> 00:19:53,491
Ted?!

509
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:56,230
Oh, my God,
I haven't seen you in so long!

510
00:19:56,296 --> 00:19:57,596
How long has it been?
Three years? No, four.

511
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:59,034
No, three, 'cause I went blonde
and then I went back

512
00:19:59,098 --> 00:20:00,228
'cause I was having
too much fun.

513
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,030
It's true what they say:
blondes have more fun.

514
00:20:02,101 --> 00:20:04,001
Oh, my God, I'm being so rude.

515
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,740
Ted, this is my fiancÃ©.

516
00:20:05,805 --> 00:20:06,735
Yes, I'm engaged.

517
00:20:06,806 --> 00:20:08,636
Ted, this is Daniel.

518
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,518
You guys

519
00:20:17,584 --> 00:20:18,824
seem perfect for each other.

520
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,945
Oh, my God.

521
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:21,489
I know, right? Totally,
it was like love at first sight.

522
00:20:21,554 --> 00:20:22,824
Hey, we should go out sometime.

523
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:24,819
Are you seeing anyone?
Because we could double-date.

524
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:25,791
Is that weird? No, it's not.

525
00:20:25,858 --> 00:20:27,528
We can go have brunch.
I know this place.

526
00:20:27,594 --> 00:20:29,034
Do you guys like popovers?
Because I love popovers.

527
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:30,595
They're like
croissants,

528
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,473
but they're a little bit less
